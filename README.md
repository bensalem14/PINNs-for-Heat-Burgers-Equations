This document includes finite differences methods(FDM) and physics informed neural networks(PINNs) on :

1. 1D heat equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=k\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}$
2. 2D heat equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=k^2(\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2})$
3. 1D burgers equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=k\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}$
4. 2D burgers equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=k(\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2})$
